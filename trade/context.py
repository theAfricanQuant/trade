    """A class to group occurrences and contextualize them.
    
    To contextualize a group of occurrences could be:
    - To identify daytrades and separate them into different occurrences
      for taxation purposes
    - Group occurrences with the same subject into one occurrence
    - Apply costs and other deductions to the value to the occurrences
    - Calculate taxes based on the occurrences in the context

    Objects from this class are created with both a list of occurrences and a
    list of functions (called "context tasks").

    The context tasks are run by calling Context.apply(). Context tasks
    run in the order they are listed.

    Every context task function receives one argument: the context itself. It
    is then free to manipulate the raw occurrence data stored in the
    Context.occurrences list.

    The contextualized occurrence data is then stored in the
    Context.contextualized list.

    The occurrences in Context.contextualized should be informed to a Holder
    as regular occurrences.

    The original Occurrence list is not modified.
