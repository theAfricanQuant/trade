    A Holder is created with a initial state regarding the subjects it
    owns. The state of Holder is then updated by Occurrence objects by
    calling Holder.trade(occurrence).

    trade apps should define the Holder.state signature according to
    their needs.

    Classes that inherit from Occurrence may add and manipulate new
    items on the Holder.state dictionary.

    Attributes:
        state: A dict representing the state of the Holder.
            The example implementation uses the following signature:
            {
                "SUBJECT SYMBOL": {
                    "quantity": 0,
