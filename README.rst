trade
-----
**trade** is a framework for the creation of financial applications.


It uses the concept of *holders*, *subjects*, *occurrences* and *contexts*
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
A *subject* represent anything that can be traded.

A *holder* is someone who owns subjects.

A *holder* state is update by *occurrences*.

*Occurrences* may occur alone or in *contexts*.


A subject is anything that can be traded
----------------------------------------
A *subject* may be the share of a corporation, livestock and so on.


A Holder is a entity that owns subjects
---------------------------------------
A Holder owns subjects. The Holder state regarding its subjects
is updated by occurrences.


*Occurrences* happen with subjects and change the state of the Holder
---------------------------------------------------------------------
A Occurrence may be caused by the Holder, like a the purchase of units of some
subject, or caused by a factor outside the Holder's will, like a stock split.
In both cases it changes the state of the Holder.


A *context* may have its own rules
----------------------------------
*Contexts* are groups of occurrences.

*Contexts* are used to pre-process occurrences before informing them to a Holder.

A *context* may be a situation where daytrades should be identified, for example.

A *context* may also involve taxes and other costs altering the details of the occurrences.


Extending the framework
-----------------------

**trade** should be extended with new types of *occurrences* and *subjects*.
New *context rules* can be created.

Look at the examples.


Live sample app
---------------
You can try it `live <https://python-trade.appspot.com>`_.

This is a sample app built with **trade**. It runs as a service; the input
is a JSON containing trade information and the service identify daytrades,
calculates the profits and losses from the occurrences, group results by
asset and more, then outputs the Holder state as a JSON.


Use:
----

A example without the use of contexts:

.. code:: python

	from trade.holder import Holder
	from trade.occurrence import Occurrence
	from trade.subject import Subject

	# create a holder
	holder = Holder()

	# define some subject
	some_asset = Subject('AST1', {})

	# create an occurrence with that subject.
	# In this example, a purchase of 100 units of the asset,
	# for the price of $20.
	some_occurrence = Occurrence(
			some_asset,
			'2018-01-02',
			{
				"quantity": 100,
				"value": 20
			}
		)

	# pass it to the holder
	holder.trade(some_occurrence)

	# check the holder state:
	for subject, state in holder.state.items():
		print(subject)
		print(state)
	# AST1
	# {'value': 20.0, 'quantity': 100}


	# create some other occurrence with that subject.
	# In this example, a sale of 20 units of the asset,
	# for the price of $30.
	holder.trade(Occurrence(
			some_asset,
			'2018-01-03',
			{
				"quantity": -20,
				"value": 30
			}
		))

	# check the holder state. It should show a change in quantity
	# and some profit:
	for subject, state in holder.state.items():
		print(subject)
		print(state)
	# AST1
	# {'price': 20.0, 'quantity': 80}


	# create some other occurrence with that subject.
	# Now a purchase of 10 units of the asset, for the
	# price of $20.
	holder.trade(Occurrence(
			some_asset,
			'2018-01-04',
			{
				"quantity": 10,
				"value": 25
			}
		))

	# check the holder state. It should show a change in quantity
	# and in the value of the subject:
	for subject, state in holder.state.items():
		print(subject)
		print(state)
	# AST1
	# {'price': 20.555555555555557, 'quantity': 90}
